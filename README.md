# SudokuMakerConstraints
This repository contains JavaScript snitteps and codes for SudokuMaker constraints and components, as used in my puzzles.

Purposes are documentation, example library and sharing. Feel free to use the code for your own puzzles.

## Contents of directories

* `functions`: JavaScript functions used in constraints or components
* `puzzles`: complete puzzles with description of creation process, custom constraints, constraint components, solution and explanations
* `concepts`: explanations of concepts regarding custom constraints or SudokuMaker custom constraint interface
* `failures`: explanations of failed ideas

## Disclaimers

* It is not guaranteed that this repository is updated frequently. Changes in SudokuMaker may not be reflected quickly, here.
You may have to adapt some code.
* Coming from a C#.NET background, my JavaScript attempts are almost guaranteed to be suboptimal, so don't count on great performance or compliance to JS-specific code style etc..
However, feel free to report issues you may find.
