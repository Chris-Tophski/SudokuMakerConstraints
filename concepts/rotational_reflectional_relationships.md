# Rotational and Reflectional Relationships

* Cells in a puzzle with a rectangular grid may have rotaional and/or reflectional relationships.
* A rotation is based on a center point, around which a rotation is performed. This point may be a cell, an edge between 2 cells or a corner between 4 cells. The rotational center does not need to be the center of the grid. The center cell (if applicable) may or may not obey the relationship.
* A reflection is based on a horizontal/vertical/diagonal line. The line may or may not intersect the center of the grid.

## Types of rotational geometry in puzzles with rectangular grids

* `90°`: Except for the center cell, there are always groups of 4 cells sharing a relationship.
* `180°`: Except for the center cell, there are always groups of 2 cells sharing a relationship.

## Types of reflectional geometry in puzzles with rectangular grids

* horizontal
* vertical
* diagonal

## Types of relationships

* same digit, digit of the same subset
* different digits
* arithmetic relationships, e. g. groups of reflected/rotated cells sum to a certain value
* ...
