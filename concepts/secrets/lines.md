# Lines

Cells in a grid may be connected by lines in order to define a relationship between some cells.
Those lines may be given or may have to be deduced.

## Line movement types

* orthogonal
* diagonal

### Examples

* Strictly orthogonal lines with some sort of oscillations (high/low or even/odd etc.) will result in a checkerboard with one color always in one category and the other color always in the other category.
* Strictly diagonal lines with some sort of oscillation will occupy one color of the checkerboard and alternate its color within one checkerboard color. There are 2 sets of diagonally connected cells.
* Lines that can move both orthogonally and diagonally don't have such a simplification property.
