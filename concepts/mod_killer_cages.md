# Modular Killer Cages

A Killer Cage is a set of orthogonally adjacent digits summing to a number that may be shown in the (usually) top left corner of the cage.
A Modular Killer Cage shows the sum (mod n) in brackets instead. For example, if `n=5` and a cage shows `[3]` in its top left corner,
the actual sum may be `3`, `8`, `13`, `18` and so on.
