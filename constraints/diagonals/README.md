# Diagonals
There are 2 main diagonals in a square-shaped puzzle, each of which has the same number of cells as each row and column.
Typically, they are called "positive" and "negative" diagonal due to their appearance in reference to the graphs of linear functions.
The naming is controversial, though, because the mathematical orientation of the y-axis increases from bottom to top, while the numbering of rows increases from top to bottom.
Therefore, the "positive"/"negative" nomenclature is actually the wrong way around, because the diagonals are flipped along the horizontal axis.
Similarly, "rising" and "falling" would refer to increasing/decreasing behavior, just still ambiguous between the mathematical and the technical orientation.

We stick to the common, albeit wrong, definition of "positive"/"negative" gradient in order to stay on the same page.
So, "positive" means from bottom left to top right and "negative" means from top left to bottom right.

In addition to the main diagonals, there are secondary diagonals everywhere along the grid, whose lengths are always smaller than those of the main diagonals.
Secondary diagonals therefore alsways contain an incomplete set of symbols. The main diagonals may or may not contain a complete set of symbols.

## Rules
Place the each symbol exactly once into each cell of the indicated diagonal(s).
