# Puzzle Constraints
Here, I try to collect puzzle constraints I come along in one way or another and document them.

## Objectives
* define a proper, unambiguous textual representation of a constraint rules
* supply a description and examples in order to make the idea behind the constraint as clear as possible
* propose a default way of visualization within puzzles
* explain implications of the constraint rules (the "secrets")
* explain variations of the constraint
* explain ways to implement the constraint in SudokuMaker
