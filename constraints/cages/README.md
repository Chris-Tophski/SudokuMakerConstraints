# Cages
An orthogonally connected set of cells enclosed in a dashed line is called a cage.
Cells in a cage have a specific property, that may optionally be described by a clue in a corner of the cage.
Depending on the specific rule a cage is used for:
* digits in it may or may not be able to repeat
* the descriptive clue (e. g. the sum) may be in the topmost, leftmost cell in its top left corner (default) or somewhere else
* there might be different cages in different styles (color, dashing pattern, line thickness etc.)
