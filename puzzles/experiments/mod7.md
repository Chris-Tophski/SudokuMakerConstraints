# Modulo 7

## Eleanor of Aquitaine

Rules:
• Normal Sudoku rules apply.
• Cells separated by a knight's move (in chess) cannot contain the same digit.
• Orthogonally adjacent cells cannot contain consecutive digits.
• The grid wraps around: antiknight and nonconsecutive constraints also apply to cells on the opposite side of the grid (e. g. r1c1 and r1c9 are nonconsecutive, r2c9 sees r9c1 by wrapped knight's move).
• Digits in cages sum to a value whose remainder (when divided by 7) is given in brackets in the top left corner of the cage.
